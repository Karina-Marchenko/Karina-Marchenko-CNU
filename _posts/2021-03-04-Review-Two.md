Summary:<br />
Black Broadway on U originated in February 2014, Washington DC. 
This project casts light on the history that lies beneath the surface through the lens and voices of local Washingtonians who remember it best. 
Black Broadway On U is a groundbreaking project that shows the public the story that had never been known as significant. 
This project represents the Black community in Washington, DC, and the critical community, known as Black Broadway, a city within a city. 
The Black greater U Street community was developed in the 19th century through the first half of the 20th century, coming out of Black Broadway. 
Despite all the discriminatory actions, the Black community persevered. 
During the Jim Crow era, Black Broadway created Washington DC’s Black Renaissance. 
This project’s website uses interactive tools and social media to create an experience of all sorts of topics. 
Black Broadway On U seeks to show its audience how similar the past, present, and future are. 

Design:<br />
Black Broadway On U was created with the intention for their audience to have a look back in time. 
Their website is designed with interactive and easily maneuverable tabs to engage the reader quickly upon entering the site. 
The website’s design is beautiful with its striking images and playful tunes that begin the experience of browsing the entire site. 
The added music under the “Home” tab towards the bottom of the screen in the activate map button starts to play soft jazz music, which adds to the website’s experience. 
It creates an atmosphere of calmness and serenity for the audience. 
Having the project’s site contain an interactive map where the audience can scan through all these significant landmarks in DC allows the viewer’s interest to be peeked in considering finding these places in DC. 
The website was comfortable navigating a laptop or a desktop computer, but it is also easy to experience on a cell phone. 
To understand the full experience, I recommend browsing on a laptop/desktop. 
The site also had made videos of artists from the black community in Washington DC. 
The audience can view what it was like for the black community in the 19th century at the height of segregation.

Relevance: <br />
The Black Broadway On U project does a great job of infiltrating their website with prominent songs and landmarks that held significance to the black community.
The project site’s directors are Shellée M. Haynesworth, Karen Parker, and Michelle Delino. 
Shellée M. Haynesworth is an award-winning multimedia maker, storyteller, and culture keeper. 
Karen Parker brings 14 years of expertise in special events planning, project management, writing, and research to the Black Broadway on U team. 
Michelle Delino is a media strategist and communications specialist with a 25+ year career working in television and public relations in New York City and Washington, DC. 
The data presented under each tab shows the many different facets of how deep and significant everything holds in Washington DC. 
The site not only shows factual data but a glimpse into how life was back then for travelers. 
The project directors offer a way to contact them under the “Contact” tab via a message through the website. 

Findings: <br />
Black Broadway On U does an incredible job of creating visuals and links that are user-friendly. 
I liked exploring the location index and going through all the Washington DC locations that held significance to the black community. 
The project site’s tabs were well informed and easy to navigate (Home, About, Stories, Discover, Behind the Scenes, Contact, and Donate). 
The website could benefit from explaining what is under each tab and give more direction. 
In the “Location Index,” there are filtered songs for the reader to enjoy as they look through the important locations. 
Overall, the project’s site is easy to browse with entertaining interactive elements. 
The website would benefit from a beginner’s tutorial on what the website is about and what the viewer can find under each tab. 
I have learned a lot throughout critiquing this site. 
I feel more informed about the history of Washington DC a little more.
