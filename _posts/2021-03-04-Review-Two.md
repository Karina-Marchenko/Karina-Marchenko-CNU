Relevance: <br />
The Black Broadway On U project does a great job of infiltrating their website with prominent songs and landmarks that held significance to the black community. 
The project site’s directors are Shellée M. Haynesworth, Karen Parker, and Michelle Delino. 
Shellée M. Haynesworth is an award-winning multimedia maker, storyteller, and culture keeper. 
Karen Parker brings 14 years of expertise in special events planning, project management, writing, and research to the Black Broadway on U team. 
Michelle Delino is a media strategist and communications specialist with a 25+ year career working in television and public relations in New York City and Washington, DC. 
The data presented under each tab shows the many different facets of how deep and significant everything holds in Washington DC. 
The site not only shows factual data but a glimpse into how life was back then for travelers. 
The project directors offer a way to contact them under the “Contact” tab via a message through the website. 

Findings: <br />
Black Broadway On U does an incredible job of creating visuals and links that are user-friendly. 
I liked exploring the location index and going through all the Washington DC locations that held significance to the black community. 
The project site’s tabs were well informed and easy to navigate (Home, About, Stories, Discover, Behind the Scenes, Contact, and Donate). 
The website could benefit from explaining what is under each tab and give more direction. 
In the “Location Index,” there are filtered songs for the reader to enjoy as they look through the important locations. 
Overall, the project’s site is easy to browse with entertaining interactive elements. 
I have learned a lot throughout critiquing this site. 
I feel more informed about the history of Washington DC a little more.
