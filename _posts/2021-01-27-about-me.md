# About Me

Hi, my name is Karina Marchenko, my preferred pronouns are she/her, and I am currently a Junior at Christopher Newport University. 
I am majoring in music, intending to get my B.A. in creative studies. 
This digital humanities course piqued my interest because I am fascinated with the social media world, and I love learning about new things that could help me with my future path and field of work. 
I am taking this course to fulfill one of my writing-intensive requirements and because, as a music major, I have never really had time to focus on my writing skills. 
After I graduate from college, my dreams are to do some hands-on work with music technology and travel within my profession. 
Ideally, I love to be doing an internship within music production in the future.
