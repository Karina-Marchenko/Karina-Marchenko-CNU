# About Me

  Hi, my name is Karina Marchenko, my preferred pronouns are she/her, and I am currently a Junior at Christopher Newport University. 
I am majoring in music, intending to get my B.A. in creative studies. 
This digital humanities course piqued my interest because I am fascinated with the social media world, and I love learning about new things that could help me with my future path and field of work. 
I am taking this course to fulfill one of my writing-intensive requirements and because, as a music major, I have never really had time to focus on my writing skills. 
After I graduate from college, my dreams are to do some hands-on work with music technology and travel within my profession. 
Ideally, I love to be doing an internship within music production in the future.

 I have always loved music and learning everything about it, which is why I am in college for music to become educated on the subject to the best of my abilities. 
I am not sure which direction I want to go in with music because I am fascinated by every aspect of the musical world around me. 
I am not typically the type of person to plan my future years ahead of time. 
I have always been one to go with the flow of life and letting it take me to places. 
I was raised in the Northern Virginia area, which happens to be close to Washington D.C. 
I recently turned 21 over the break, and it was a fascinating birthday, even though we are still in the middle of a pandemic. 
  
  I have two bulldogs, both being miniature compared to the ordinarily large size of bulldogs. 
Both of their names have a back story; my female bulldog is named Bubbles from the Powerpuff Girls cartoon show from Cartoon Network. 
My male dog is named Boomer, after the Bubbles counterpart from the Powerpuff Girls episode “Bubble Boy.” 
Some artists I love are Ariana Grande, Giveon, Kehlani, Megan Thee Stallion, One Direction, Adele, SZA, and many more. 
Being so involved with music, the type of genres I love to listen to and indulge in is Rap, R&B, Musicals, and a little bit of Pop.
