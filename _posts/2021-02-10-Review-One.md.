Summary:
Bob Damron traveled around the late 1950s into the early 1960s, wanting to find bars to meet other men similar to him. Damron wanted more than just a fling, he wanted friends, companions, and to find shelter in others in the cities he ventured. As he traveled around, he began taking note of all the names of spots he had often encountered. His innovative records became the foundation of the soon to be famous gay travel guide published in 1964. Bob Damron named his Address Books after himself when broadcasting them to ensure fellow gay and queer travelers’ safety. These Address Books became survival guides practically to gay and queer travelers across the United States. Bob Damron published his first Address Book in 1964 when most states forbade same-sex intimacy in public and private areas. These travel guides helped gay people find bars, cocktail lounges, bookstores, restaurants, bathhouses, cinemas, and cruising grounds catered to people like themselves. Like the Green Books of the 50s and 60s, which helped African Americans find trusted businesses that would provide black citizens in the age of Jim Crow apartheid. Bob Damron’s Address Books served as a generation of queer people in identifying sites of community, pleasure, and politics.
