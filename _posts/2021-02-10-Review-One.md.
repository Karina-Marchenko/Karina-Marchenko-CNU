Summary:
Bob Damron traveled around the late 1950s into the early 1960s, wanting to find bars to meet other men similar to him. 
Damron wanted more than just a fling, he wanted friends, companions, and to find shelter in others in the cities he ventured. 
As he traveled around, he began taking note of all the names of spots he had often encountered. 
His innovative records became the foundation of the soon to be famous gay travel guide published in 1964. 
Bob Damron named his Address Books after himself when broadcasting them to ensure fellow gay and queer travelers’ safety. 
These Address Books became survival guides practically to gay and queer travelers across the United States. 
Bob Damron published his first Address Book in 1964 when most states forbade same-sex intimacy in public and private areas. 
These travel guides helped gay people find bars, cocktail lounges, bookstores, restaurants, bathhouses, cinemas, and cruising grounds catered to people like themselves. 
Like the Green Books of the 50s and 60s, which helped African Americans find trusted businesses that would provide black citizens in the age of Jim Crow apartheid. 
Bob Damron’s Address Books served as a generation of queer people in identifying sites of community, pleasure, and politics. 

Design:
Mapping The Gay Guides was designed with methodological decisions that shape the resulting dataset. 
The goal was to make visible the choices that were made and clarify our categorization of the data. 
This project’s design tactics are fun, bright colors to interest the viewer to look under every tab to get more information. 
The website was more comfortable with laptops or desktop computers to give the project’s full effect as a viewer. 
The site makes it easy to find out more information about many businesses and establishments from Bob Damron’s Address Books. 
Having the project’s site interactive draws the reader to place themselves in the history and better experience what it had been like in that period to be a gay/queer traveler. 
Under the “Map” tab, a map from 1965 to 1980 from all across the world shows precisely where the establishments’ Bob Damron had come across in his travels. 
The map uses Google Verified Location, which means a location that could be verified using Google’s Geocoding API. 
A verified place means if a business doesn’t have a standard address that could geocode, the area was verified manually by a member of the MGG team. 
When locations cannot be verified automatically or manually, the site includes the city’s general coordinates. 
It has also included a checkbox that allows viewers to filter out these locations and look only at verified locations.

Relevance: 
The project does a great job of utilizing landmarks and technology to locate safe havens for gay and queer travelers. 
The project site’s directors are Dr. Amanda Regan and Dr. Eric Gonzaba. 
Dr. Amanda Regan is a historian of the late-nineteenth and twentieth centuries. 
Dr. Eric Gonzaba is a specialist in African American history and LGBTQIA culture. 
The information presented under each tab shows many different factors in the Bob Damron Address Books. 
The site not only shows factual data but a glimpse into how life was back then for travelers. 
The project directors offer under the “About” tab a way to contact them via email or Twitter. 
They also link a way to cite the website when researching them. 

Findings: 
Mapping the Gay Guides does an incredible job of creating visuals and links that are user-friendly. 
I liked examining all the tabs and going through each year from 1965 through 1980. 
The site’s tabs were well informed and easy to navigate (Vignettes, Methodology, Ethics, News, Map, and About). 
The website could benefit from explaining what is under each tab and give more direction.
On the “Map” tab, the map is very interactive, with being able to see all around the world from 1965 to 1980 shows the evolution throughout. 
Overall, the project’s site is well informed and put together. 
I have learned a lot throughout reviewing this site, feeling as a viewer enticed when exploring.
