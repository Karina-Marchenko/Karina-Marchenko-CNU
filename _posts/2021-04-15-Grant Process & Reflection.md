# Grant Process & Reflection 

My project is all about Music technology in the Digital humanities space. 
Music technology has many aspects, but what I will be focusing on in my project is coding and the history of music technology. 
This project interests me because I have spent my whole college career studying music and, more specifically, focusing on music technology in my last two years. 
Music is a vast subject with many sub-subjects to be learned. 
The best part about the music world is that many don’t know that music technology plays a significant role in what comes next in technology.

Yes, my project is still relatively the same as my abstract as to when I first started brainstorming and planning it. 
I would say now that it is more fleshed out and has a specific goal in mind. 
I am even more proud of my project now than I was at the beginning of this project process. 
Yes, I have found a couple of Digital Humanities projects similar to mine. 
That said, I haven’t found any that are almost identical to my project. 
My project is more based on the music technology world and how coding is at its heart. 
To differentiate my project from the others out there on the internet.

I have decided to go with the coding music route. 
Coding is used worldwide by many people, and why not include the ins and outs of coding music on my project’s website. 
I would have cheat sheets underneath the coding declaring what they do in the code to produce sound. 
At the same time, it is live coding to the viewer in real-time. 
My views changed on how to write a grant tremendously by giving me as the viewer my tips and tricks on how detailed they can get. 
Grants can also come in many shapes and sizes. 
I went into this final project not understanding what a grant project would even entail but now nearing the end of the semester, and I feel confident to write one again.

Digital Humanities has shown me how in-depth it is and how essential it is to technology today. 
I would have never known that music technology and digital humanities tie within each other if it wasn’t for taking this class. 
At the beginning of this semester, I would have defined digital humanities as a field of study involved with the crossing of computing and the humanities disciplines. At the end of this semester, I have grown to learn accurately what the digital humanities is and thoroughly done my research within it over time. 

The readings helped a significant amount when we had to go on to Twitter and tweet about our thoughts. 
It made the readings not feel so intimidating by breaking them down and having the option to discuss them with our classmates. 
The specific readings that had diagrams and broke down helpful tips were the most beneficial when tied within the projects we were completing. 
Reading articles related to the projects helped show what you needed to work on to elevate it.

The assignments we have completed this semester are some of the most abstract projects I have done within my college experience. 
I enjoyed it when we reviewed digital humanities projects’ and created reviews on them by thoroughly going through each website section. 
My least favorite assignment was when we coded TEI and created a blog post to coincide with the code. 
Not that the project was too challenging, but coding can be very selective when inserted incorrectly. 
Completing the TEI coding project gave a better understanding of how broad digital humanities can become. 
Since these assignments were different from what I had typically done in the past, I have since then had an encompassing understanding of the digital humanities.

In my opinion, I have grown tremendously throughout this course. 
I have learned how to write outside of my comfort zone by being able to code. I have done many assignments in this course that I have never done before. 
Being pushed out of my comfort zone, I believe this course has a significant impact on my future. I am so much more familiar with the digital humanities space that I feel confident to continue doing my research within the field if needed.
