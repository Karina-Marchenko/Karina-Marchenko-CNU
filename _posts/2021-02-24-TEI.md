# TEI Blog 

After reading **“The Yellow Wall-paper”** by Charlotte Perkins Stetson in class, we were all given separate sections from the autobiography to code using the Text Encoding Initiative, or TEI for short. 
“The Yellow Wall-paper” is an autobiography written about Stetson’s postpartum depression published in 1892. 
The pages I was assigned were from 31 to 34. 
With these pages, as a class, we used **Oxygen, XML (Extensive Markup Language) editor,** to analyze the text’s code on each page. 
The first step we took before coding the text into Oxygen was viewing our sections of “The Yellow Wall-paper” in Google Docs. 
From there, we went and commented and analyzed every page of text to see the things we would have to fix in the program, Oxygen.

My pages, at first glance, didn’t seem to have many “errors,” but as a looked more thoroughly through, I started seeing all the small details I would need to code into Oxygen. 
The main thing I noticed was the extra space marks and all the quotes placed throughout the pages. 
In “The Yellow Wall-paper,” the author, Stetson, tends to separate her paragraphs by each sentence. 
At first glance, I was nervous about coding “The Yellow Wall-paper,” before going into this project, I didn’t know what to expect. 
As a music technology student, I have had to experience coding music into many different programs but never actually coding sentences. 

I thought that coding words would be a complicated concept, even though we as a class have been creating code with our other GitHub assignments. 
In my brain, this project seemed completely different compared to what we have been doing. 
After the short tutorial we were given, I was shocked at how easy XML looked to use. 
After coding everything I needed to, I surely thought that this could not possibly be this easy and only have a small problem that the code could be fixed relatively easily. 
Overall, I feel more informed on coding, and it looks scarier than it is. 
XML is all about attention to detail and being quite meticulous with the inserted text. 
I saw myself taking my time to make sure every detail was correct. 
I cannot see myself using this type of coding again, but I know now I have it in my back pocket if I ever need it.
